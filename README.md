# Investment and Bond Calculator

This project is a simple calculator that helps you calculate the amount of interest you'll earn on your investment or the amount you'll have to pay on a home loan (bond).

## Description

This project contains a Python script that calculates the interest amount for investments and the monthly repayment amount for home loans (bonds). It provides a menu-based interface where the user can select either the investment or bond option and provide the necessary details for the calculation.

The script uses basic mathematical formulas and the math module to perform the calculations accurately. It also incorporates error handling to handle invalid user inputs and display appropriate error messages.

## Getting Started

To use the calculator, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the project files as a ZIP archive.
2. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine (version 3 or above).
3. Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the script using the command python investment_bond_calculator.py.
5. You will see a menu with two options: "investment" and "bond".
6. Enter either 'investment' or 'bond' from the menu to proceed.
7. Follow the prompts and provide the required information for the calculation.
8. The script will display the calculated result based on your inputs.

# Usage Instructions

## Investment Calculation

If you choose the "investment" option, you will be asked to provide the following details:

Deposit: Enter the amount you will deposit. This should be a numerical value.
Interest Rate: Enter the interest rate. This should be a numerical value (e.g., 7 for 7%).
Years to Invest: Enter the number of years you plan to invest. This should be a whole number.
Interest Type: Choose the type of interest: "simple" or "compound". Enter your selection as a string.
After providing the required information, the program will calculate the total interest amount based on your inputs and display the result.

## Bond Calculation
If you choose the "bond" option, you will be asked to provide the following details:

Current House Value: Enter the current value of the house. This should be a numerical value.
Yearly Interest Rate: Enter the yearly interest rate for the bond. This should be a numerical value (e.g., 7 for 7%).
Months to Repay: Enter the number of months you plan to repay the bond. This should be a whole number.
After providing the required information, the program will calculate the total monthly repayments for the bond based on your inputs and display the result.

## Notes

Decimal values can be entered for the deposit and interest rate to provide more accurate calculations.
The interest rate is divided by 100 to convert it from a percentage to a decimal value for the calculation.
The calculation results are rounded to 2 decimal places for easier readability.
